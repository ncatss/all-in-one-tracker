# all-in-one-tracker
it's a centralized place that tracks daily things like restaurant visits, pet flee & tick, flight start/end time, reservation code etc

I started doing this because I like to record everything - and I wanted a centralized spot for myself to find everything
and I wanted it to be a little bit more simple & user friendlier than going to sheets. so here we are!

main sections are mostly based off 吃喝玩乐(eat, drink, travel, entertainment), and I'm just adding whatever I need as I go

- 吃🍽️ - tracks restaurants! Never go to same bad place again!
  - ➕ add new visit
  - 📜 show all visits history (can be filtered by value in selected column, and also sorted asc/dsc by any column)
  - 📊 show summary - it will group data based on selected "GroupBy" columns, and then display summary of data in "AggBy" columns - 
  - 🍕 pizza-day countdown - I made a vow to eat pizza for my husband once per two months, so here we go

- 喝🧋 - tracks drinks 🧋🍺☕, remember favorite flavors!

  - same ➕📜📊, just for drinks

- 玩✈️ - tracks travel details ✈️🚗🏨, no more going back to email over and over just to pull up landing time!
  - ✈️: add flight detail.
  - 🚗: add rental car detail.
  - 🏨: add hotel detail.
  - 📅: add activity and other reservation detail.
  - 🧳: search all items for selected trip.
  - 📜: View history with filter & sort options.

- 乐🎮 - tracks hobbies! 🎬📺🐉,🧱📈🏋️💡.
  - 🎬: record tv shows/movies/animes, watchlist.
  - 🧱: record lego purchases & finish building time.
  - 🎵: songs stuck in head/liked songs.
  - 🎮: activities, mostly things doing with other people.
  - 💡: random ideas come to mind.
  - 🤩: things that made me happy.

- ❤️ - tracks health, abnormal symptoms etc

- 🐾 - tracks pets! flee & tick, bath schedule, fun memories, abnormal behavior 

A little bit extra:
everything is saved local, so if you wanna view/update across devices (like between phone & laptop etc)
you will need to create a google apps script token to use the cloud functionality, use ☁️ to add/update/delete the token.
see cloud_instructions.md for more details

TODO:
setting option to update table, customize displayed button etc
