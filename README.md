# all-in-one-tracker
it's a centralized place that tracks daily things like restaurant visits, pet flee & tick, flight start/end time, reservation code etc

I started doing this because I like to record everything - and I wanted a centralized spot for myself to find everything
and I wanted it a little bit more simple & user friendly than going to sheets. so here we are!

main sections are mostly based off 吃喝玩乐, and I'm just adding whatever I need as I go

- 吃🍽️ - record restaurant visits! and avoid the bad ones!!

  - ➕ add new visit
  
  - 📜 show all visits history (can be filtered by name, and also sorted by any column)
  
  - 📊 show summary - see what's your top hit!

  - 🍕 pizza-day countdown - I made a vow to eat pizza for my husband once per two months, so here we go

- 喝🧋 - record boba teas! remember the favorite flavors details etc; and dessert, alcohol etc things that needs some self-control

- 玩✈️ - record travel details! I'm tired of searching email for when my flight land etc on booking rental etc - so it's gonna have all details related to travel, fun events that happens at a reserved time!

- 乐🎬 - record things make me happy! like shows, movies, anime etc, hobbies like lego, tennis etc 

- 📈 - record investment (...haven't decided what exactly to do about this one)

- 🐾 - record pets activities - like flee & tick count down, bath count down, abnormal behavior like diarehea, vomiting etc

A little bit extra:
everything is saved local, so if you wanna view/update across devices (like between phone & laptop etc)
you will need to create a google apps script token to use the cloud functionality, use ☁️ to add/update/delete the token.
see cloud_instructions.md for more details
